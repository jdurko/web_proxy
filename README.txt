PLEASE make sure you know the server ip address you are runing the code on. The port number we have chosen is 8888.

To compile our code,open a terminal and type:   g++ -pthread  -o ProxyC ProxyDK.cpp

To execute our code type:  ./ProxyC 

Now open a browser like Internet Explorer or Chrome ant type:
http://ip_address:port_number/website.
For example on CSE06 UNT machine we type http://129.120.151.99:8888/www.google.com

*Case: Only when your environment paths C/C++ are not linked to your program directory

Please to compile, you may specify 
to the compiler the directory for input files 
by using the  Path To your Directory of code, I mean  by typing
g++ -pthread Path_To_Directory\Code Path_To_Directory\Code\ProxyDK.cpp
